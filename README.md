## Name
Archasm

## Description
Our project is a 2d pixel-based survival game similar to Terraria where the player battles monsters, collects loot, defeats bosses, and mines rare ores. Everything doesnt have to be about action though, you can explore the world, build structures, and have endless fun. Unlike Terraria, the game has a storyline for the player to follow, where you need to save the world from the evil final villain. The game will have procedural world generation with chunking, allowing the player to explore an infinite world.
